    Notes
    -----
    This is implemented as a :class:`~django.db.models.OneToOneField` with
    ``on_delete=CASCADE``, meaning: if the referenced `User` object is deleted,
    all referencing `Event` objects are discarded aswell.

    To keep this application as pluggable as possible, the referenced class is
    dependent on :setting:`AUTH_USER_MODEL`. With this implementation, the
    project may substitute the :class:`~django.contrib.auth.models.User` model
    provided by Django without breaking any functionality in `calingen` (see
    :djangodoc:`Reusable Apps and AUTH_USER_MODEL <topics/auth/customizing/#reusable-apps-and-auth-user-model>`).
