Event Provider
**************

|calingen| provides a *plugin interface* for the provision of events by
plugins.

Technically, *event providers* are provided as standalone Django applications
that register themselves with |calingen| and are integrated into the general
workflow of the app (see :ref:`calingen-user-doc-generate-inlays-label`),
therefore they may be installed like any other application into the Django
project: just add them to the project's settings module in
:setting:`INSTALLED_APPS`.

.. note::
  Even more technically: Event providers are implementations of the app's
  plugin mount point :class:`~calingen.interfaces.plugin_api.EventProvider`.
  See :ref:`calingen-dev-doc-plugins-eventprovider-label` for details.

*Event providers* are selectable by the user in his profile settings.


Included Event Providers
========================

|calingen| ships with one *event provider* out of the box. It is included in
:mod:`calingen.contrib.providers`.

.. warning::
  While this provider is *available* when |calingen| is installed, it must be
  *activated* manually by including it in :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS`.

German Holidays
  Provides the holidays of the Federal Republic of Germany, split by its
  federal states.

  .. note::
    All federal states are included and will be selectable in the user's
    profile.
