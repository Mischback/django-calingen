Events
******

The actual key feature of |calingen| is the generation of calendar inlays.
During that generation process, *calendar entries*, like birthdays, holidays
and appointments are automatically included in the output.

*Events* are a more abstract representation of the *calendar entries*, e.g.:

.. hint::
  Your dog's birthday is February, 3rd 2022.

  But obviously you want to include
  its birthday in every generated calendar, for all years to come (2023, ...).

  The *event* is ``2022-02-03, Dog's Birthday``, but the calendar entries will
  be ``2022-02-03, Dog's Birthday``, ``2023-02-03, Dog's Birthday``, ...


Event Sources
=============

*Events* can originate from two different sources:

Internal Events
  These *events* are created with |calingen|, using the app's
  :class:`~calingen.models.event.Event` model.

External Events
  These *events* are provided by plugins, implementing the app's
  :class:`~calingen.interfaces.plugin_api.EventProvider` interface. See
  :ref:`calingen-cookbook-ingredients-eventprovider-label` for details.


Event Categories
================

|calingen| defines different categories of *events* in
:class:`calingen.constants.EventCategory`, namely

- Annual Anniversaries
- Holidays

.. note::
  This list might be extended, see :issue:`16`.

*Internal events*, as described above, are required to include one of these
pre-defined categories. For *external events* this is recommended but not
enforced.
