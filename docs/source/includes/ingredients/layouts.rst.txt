Layouts
*******

|calingen| uses *layouts* to format the actual calendar inlays.
Basically they are sets of templates used to present the app's data (which is a
list of events for a given user).

Technically, *layouts* are provided as standalone Django applications that
register themselves with |calingen| and are integrated into the
general workflow of the app (see
:ref:`calingen-user-doc-generate-inlays-label`), therefore they may be
installed like any other application into the Django project: just add them to
the project's settings module in :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS`.

.. note::
  Even more technically: Layouts are implementations of the app's plugin mount
  point :class:`~calingen.interfaces.plugin_api.LayoutProvider`. See
  :ref:`calingen-dev-doc-plugins-layoutprovider-label` for details.

*Layouts* are **rendered** to their respective result. This means, that the
project's template engine is used to **render** a layout's templates to a
:py:obj:`string <str>` which can be processed further by a compiler (see
:ref:`calingen-cookbook-ingredients-compilers-label` and :setting:`TEMPLATES`).


Included Layouts
================

|calingen| provides three example layouts out of the box. They are
included in :mod:`calingen.contrib.layouts`.

.. warning::
  While these layouts are *available* when |calingen| is installed,
  they must be *activated* manually by including them in
  :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS`.

Simple Event List
  This is just an easy example of a layout, that processes the given list of
  Event instances (both, user-provided and externally provided) and creates
  TeX sources for compilation with a TeX compiler (like ``pdflatex``).

  The layout does not provide a configuration form, as it does not have any
  options.

  During processing, the Event instances are grouped by their month.

Year By Week
  This slightly more complex example actually creates a list of all days of
  the year, include Event instances and then creates TeX sources.

  There is no configuration form.

  It visualizes, how a complete calendar can be generated.

Lineatur
  This layout may be used to generate ruled paper sheets to augment a
  calendar.

  It will generate HTML sources (and might even provide a valid HTTP response
  in combination with an appropriate compiler).

  This layout provides a configuration form.
